Make web pages for the tip calculator and alarm.  Add the html and css validator links on each page.  Put the pages on your 
github.io site and put links to them on your github pages homepage.  Submit the link to your github pages homepage in your 
status report.  Note that all of your files will have to be in your github.io repository and in the expected relative folders 
according to the path names on your html pages.

Make the tip caclculator compute and display correct tip value in an unobtrusive way.

Make the alarm application work as expected in an unobtrusive way. See alarm.gif image

Extra credit 1(This is optional for those who are looking for more material.)
  Look at the powTests.html file in the lesson13events folder of the 301DemosNew repository.  Use it as 
  an example of how to run and display the results of Mocha tests in the browser.  Do the same
  pattern for one or more of your homeworks from this course--e.g., arrayMethodTests, arrayReviewTests, 
  recursionTests.  Put these pages into your github.io repository and links to them 
  on your homepage.
  
Extra credit 2:  Look at the instructions on pages 2 and 3 of the github pages setup instructions 
in the Resources / assignments folder on Sakai.  Try using those to link put links to your 
301 repository files without copying them to the github pages repository.
