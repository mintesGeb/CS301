I have finished 80-90% of the assignment and it is pushed to github. It took me the part of the
afternoon class and some minutes after that. so around 2.5 hours.

In these assignments, I got to practice my coding skills a little bit more and testing with mocca 
became more easier with practice.

I have updated my file with "l8arrays" so it will run on your test file without error for the ones 
I finished writing function for.

Todays lesson on arrays is mostly revision but it was needed because it is a major element of js.
Most of my time after class was spent on TA duties, helping students use the mocca and jsdoc as well as 
eslint.

I have used arr.pop() and arr.push() often in the past .
but I didnt use shifting & unshifting much, but because these add/remove elements to the array 
to/from the front of the queue, the add a huge functionality. just like i used them on the exercise.

The combination makes them a lot more functional.

function rotateArrayLeft(arr) {
  let shiftingElement = arr.shift();
  arr.push(shiftingElement);
  return arr;
}


Thanks
