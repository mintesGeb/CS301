Todays lesson and assignment was almost new knowledge to me, which I liked .
It challenged me and needed my my full undevided attention throughout the lecture 
and practice afterwards. 

-I have completed almost all jsdoc requirements (uploaded to Github link above)
-I have all three installs and integrations into my IDE (also uploaded)
-I will practice and read more about mocha, now and tomorrow morning also.

The use of jsdoc organizes documents and helps build good discipline/habit of documenting 
right in a d.table. and the display in an html window is amazing too.

I knew the function of mocha has a lot of application in the industry, but now that I can
read and write JS it is kind of understandable and doable.



Thank you
