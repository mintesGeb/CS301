Today's assignment was not as difficult as it  has been the past few days. It took me around  an hour during 
afternoon lab. But the concept of recursion is not as easy. Nor the functionality is as negligible. It is
very useful. I am also reading through js.info materials which are very uselful. It has additional 
array methods and string methods. I'm catching up on these materials while working on the project and 
consulting other students, in thier challenges(TA duties).

The project has some challenging quesions. it's helping me read through some other documentation .
And I have also started working on the mocha files for the final project. 

recursion makes some programs and codes easy to write and read. understanding how it works
isn't hard. but when it comes to efficiency and speed it may have it's own disadvantages.
but at this point we dont worry much about that.

Thanks,
Mintes
