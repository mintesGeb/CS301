Hi Professor, this is Mintes.

I have answered all the questions and coding exercises. I was able to finish few minutes after class ended and compiled them into github.
the difficulty level was easy although the practice helped me remember what I have practiced in the past. All in all 2 hours is what it took me to finish.
I also remembered to push the final touch up of my codes and text files.
-I haven't encountered any problems in this day exercise, and  it is because I am revising all this and not my first time.

I did learn new things and preferred methods during this class and reading assignment. I was able write neat and working codes.

-The (+) preceeding "prompt" changes the string input into number.
-The (??) operator checks if the first number is defined or not null before returning it or the other operand.


Question 
-I couldn't find !! operator anywhere in the reading . I do know the meaning of ! , || , && and ?? 
but !! is what is in the assignemt and It is something to learn in class in the morning in class.
