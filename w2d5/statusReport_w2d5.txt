This weeks assignments(Thursday and Friday) are really good exercises on problem solving(even though
thet are focused on arrays) - arrays are essential part of programming.

Thursdays exercises helped make Fridays questions easier and the new array methods we learned
such as slice, splice , for ...of ,  concat, index of , indcludes, reverse, join etc.
have made different problems easier to solve. Looping through arrays is a common process
to perform and solve different problems. creating empty arrays and pushing in solutions is a common
way to get an array to return.
