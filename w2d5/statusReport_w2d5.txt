This weeks assignments(Thursday and Friday) are really good exercises on problem solving(even though
thet are focused on arrays) - arrays are essential part of programming. it has taken me about two
hour in each of the three days, to revise and work on the exercises.

Thursdays exercises helped make Fridays questions easier and the new array methods we learned
such as slice, splice , for ...of ,  concat, index of , indcludes, reverse, join etc.
have made different problems easier to solve. Looping through arrays is a common process
to perform and solve different problems. creating empty arrays and pushing in solutions is a common
way to get an array to return.

One thing I am having trouble with is the  mocha testng. On some specific problems the mocha test 
fails to work despite a lot of debugging when the same test as worked in a simple test in the
console. It may be syntax errors in the given mocha test file but that frustrates a lot , esp when
it takes so much time and still doesnt work. but its importnt to consider this as part of the 
profession. Little problems and errors can cause a huge program to fail and not work.

Thank You
