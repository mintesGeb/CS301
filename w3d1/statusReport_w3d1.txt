Hi Prof,
I have completed all the assignemnt questions for today and will continue to read on the reading materials and 
assisting other students the rest of the day. It has taken me around and hour and a half to complete
and test my solution in the mocha. Everything passed through the mocha test fine.

Although the topic of objects is broad and i know they are used very frequently in programming, today
we only got started and it was fairly simple(not too hard to grasp).

Strings are premitives we have been working with till now and most of the string methods are similar to
array methods , so it is understandable as well. 

 Lesson learned today:
the difference between objects and premitives:
objects are stored and copied by reference but premitive values are copied "as whole value"

I also have started working on the final project. Will there be a mocha file for it or no?


Thanks 
Mintes
