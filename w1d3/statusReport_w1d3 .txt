Hi Professor, this is Mintes.

I have answered all the assignment questions and I was able to finish in about 2.5 hours.
The coding assignment is helping me solidify my knowlege prior to this program. Most of 
the concepts are revisions for me, I'm learning some new things nevertheless.

I learned the importance of the break statement in the 'switch' conditional branching.
If we dont use break, it will continue to execute the next commands and statements.

I also was, because of the exercises, able to see and distinguish which problems need 
progaming solution that uses the 'switch' or the 'if/else' conditional branching .

Question:

Do you prefer readablity of a code or simplicity/neat/short of a code. Because when we 
learn different ways of doing one thing , we must also know the effect and have a reasonable
preferences.

p.s.
-all the class exercises and coding examples are in one VS code file, classExercise.js
-the table for 4, 5 are in the word file that has the programing exercise

thank you
