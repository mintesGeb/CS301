Hi Prof,
Here is a link to the homepage to my website. It hasn't taken me more than two hours to build
the static website. But to finish and link with the javascript content(DOM) some unexpected prooblems
arise and correcting those was a little time taking.

I have practiced this atleast once in the past. It is another good practice for me but I wish there 
was a small project we can do in groups to strengthn our knowledge and put it to practie. In the
already formed groups we can make a good styled website. Other wise next month would be a totally different 
subject and none of this knowledge would be usable.

I havent hosted webpage in github pages in the past so this would be the first time.

Question
I havent been able to see what the validator does.
Could you show us what it benefit and usage is like?

Thank you 
Mintes
