all coding is pushed to github under CS301/w1d5

From Reading: 

1. alternatives to default parameters - setting a default value for parameter not in the function 
declaration but at it's execution stage.

eg : 
function printText (text){
if (text === undefined){
text="no text";
}
console.log(text);
}
printText();




2. its function plus the object of the function
eg: 
showMessage()
calcAge();

3. The naming of a function should be able to tell what it does. and a function 
has to be simple enough that it performs one action and not try to do everything at ones.
In which case, we'd want to comment on it a lot. when it is simple enough it's 
as good as it is commented.
