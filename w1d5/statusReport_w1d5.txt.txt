Hello Professor,

I have answered all the assignment questions. and I was able to finish in 3 hours.
Function is a core concept and I took my time reading and absorbing all the new info. from
javascript.info . I am familiar with the concept but there are new knowledge I learned today.
Especially about Lexical scope in JS , and scope chain.
I would like to say this concept is well explained an all the examples are made to
deliver the concept in a very easy way. Thank you for that.

When we refer to a variable in a program, JS engine will look for that
variable in the current scope. If it doesnâ€™t find it, it will look for it its
outer scope until it reach the global scope. 

The stacking diagrams that you used to illustrate what the compiler does was effective 
to show the process.

I thought today's(friday's) class was different from the previous days. How you handeled 
the class and managed our class time was very effective. Because students come from different
background they may have different questions to ask or make comments but to take all that 
and think of the whole class and evaluating if its worth to deal with it right then and there
is a class management/handling skill. I thought I was done very well today and that gave us
enough time to focus on the difficult and core JS concepts and go thorugh the lecture in an
appropriate pace.

Thank you
Mintes
