Hi, this is Mintes.

I have answered all the questions and I was able to finish just before lab time ended which means it took me about an hour.
THe difficulty level was pretty easy except the use of technology and manuvering the assignment submission process took some time.

since I have taken this weeks course to get ready for the JS test, I was pretty familiar with most of the concepts , but I did learn a lott.
one of the things I learned is the importance of using "use strict"; for the developer. It restricts the addition of variables without intention,
it restricts type mistakes and helps us double check the property of a variable we create.

Since I practiced a little bit of js, I took the exampled we learned in class (prime numbers) and practiced writing code. it can be viewd in my github link.

Thank you for taking time to listen to online students and taking questions. I also want to thank you for fixing mic related issues in the morning, our experience was 
much more improved after that.

Question
-How do you compare browser code editors and independent code editors? What are appropriate usage of both?

Thank you
